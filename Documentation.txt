#Documentation

Bookmyshow_Scraper is a project developed by Sayash Raaj under the guidance of Mr.Prakhar, Adorithm.
The webscraping project scrapes Bookmyshow.com, a website aimed at movie tickets booking.
The project aims to obtain data regarding movies, for example: timing of movie, cinema name, subregion of cinema, etc.
The data can be used for further analysis and development, possibly including correlations between sets of data variables

#Major File Contents of the project:

url.txt
urls.txt
bookmyshow.csv
urlsupply.py
bookmyshow.py

#Basic Information

url.txt					stores the initial urls to be input
urls.txt				stores the processed urls with additional urls generated by urlsupply.py for automating url input
bookmyshow.csv			stores final data
urlsupply.py 			program to refine and generate additional URLs with date modification and store in urls.txt
bookmyshow.py 			Spider to crawl URL of urls.txt and output to bookmyshow.csv

#Setting Up Virtual Envrionment

Pip freeze>requirements.txt has been generated to aid in installing venv (virtual environment) libraries and additional settings

pip install -r requirements.txt
the singular command to set up identical venv to test, develop and run the project files

#Working of Project

The project is initialised by urlsupply.py
urlsupply.py takes in input by utilising python inbuilt function readlines()
urlsupply takes in system date to append to shortened string variable of url read usign readlines()
url is shortened by [:-9] to remove the date element of URL
nested for loops:
	for cycling through urls read by readlines()
	for cycling through generating outputs between range specified by developer
url.txt stores manual input, test data included in repository

url.txt-->urlsupply-->urls.txt-->bookmyshow.py-->items.py-->bookmyshow.csv

bookmyshow.py is the core part of the project: Spider crawling through input pages from urls.txt generated earlier
Spider crawls webpage in a for loop, storing data as list initialised in items.py
Spider named 'bms', abbreviation for Bookmyshow, crawls webpages for:
	name of cinema
	subregion of cinema
	timings of the shows available in the specific cinema
	percentage of empty seats in the cinema
	date of show
Spider crawls the webpage under li.list and initiates a for loop with yield inside the loop to obtain the output in a ordered format in the .csv file, in an organised manner.
